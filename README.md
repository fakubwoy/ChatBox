**Socket Chat** is a simple yet powerful real-time chat application with file sharing, emojis, text formatting, and a responsive user interface. It consists of a Python-based server and a modern web client. No external libraries or installations are required, making it lightweight and easy to set up.

## Key Features

## Server Setup

1. **Install Python 3.x:** Ensure Python 3.x is installed and working on your system.
2. **Prepare the Server:**
   - Save the provided server code into a file named `server.py`.

   - Start the server with the command:
     ```bash
     python server.py
